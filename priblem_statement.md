Problem Statement
Objective:
Develop a machine learning pipeline that classifies customer support tickets by their issue type and urgency level, and extracts key entities (e.g., product names, dates, complaint keywords). The file (ai_dev_assignment_tickets_complex_1000 ) is provided.
Assignment Tasks
1. Data Preparation
•     You are provided with an Excel file (ai_dev_assignment_tickets_complex_1000 ) containing anonymized customer support ticket data with the following columns:
o    ticket_id
o    ticket_text
o    issue_type (label)
o    urgency_level (label: Low, Medium, High)
o    product (ground truth for entity extraction)
•     Clean and preprocess the data, including but not limited to:
o    Text normalization (lowercase, removing special characters)
o    Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
o    Handling missing data
2. Feature Engineering
•     Create meaningful features using traditional NLP techniques:
o    Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, or similar
o    Extract additional features such as ticket length, sentiment score, etc.
•     Justify your feature selection in the documentation.
3. Multi-Task Learning
•     Build and train two separate models:
1. Issue Type Classifier: Predict the ticket's issue_type (multi-class classification) 2. Urgency Level Classifier: Predict the urgency_level (multi-class classification)
•     Use any classical ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.).
4. Entity Extraction•     Using traditional NLP, extract key entities from ticket_text:
o    Product names (from a provided product list or using regex/rule-based methods)
o    Dates mentioned in the text
o    Complaint keywords (e.g., “broken”, “late”, “error”)
•     Return extracted entities as a dictionary.
5. Integration
•     Write a function that takes raw ticket_text as input and returns:
o    Predicted issue_type
o    Predicted urgency_level
o    Extracted entities (as a JSON/dictionary)
6. Gradio Interface (Optional)
•     Build an interactive Gradio web app where users can:
o    Input raw ticket text
o    See the predicted issue type, urgency, and extracted entities as output
